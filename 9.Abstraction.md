## 3. Abstraction

### Definition

Abstraction is the **process of hiding implementation details** and showing only the **essential features** of an object. In Java, it allows a programmer to focus on **what an object does** rather than **how it does it**.

Abstraction in Java can be implemented using:

1. **Abstract Classes**  
2. **Interfaces**

---

### 1. **Using Abstract Classes**

Occurs when a **class is declared as `abstract`** and contains **abstract methods** (without body) that must be **overridden by subclasses**.

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw(); // abstract method

    void info() { // concrete method
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}

public class AbstractClassExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape s = new Circle();
        s.draw();  // calls Circle's implementation
        s.info();  // calls Shape's concrete method
    }
}
````

**Output:**

```
Drawing a Circle
This is a shape.
```

**Key Points:**

* Abstract methods **have no body**; concrete methods may exist.
* Forces subclasses to provide their **own implementation**.
* Can have **constructors, data members, and methods**.

---

### 2. **Using Interfaces**

Occurs when a **class implements an interface**, which is a **completely abstract blueprint** with **abstract methods**.

```java
interface Animal {
    void sound(); // abstract method
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class InterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a1 = new Dog();
        Animal a2 = new Cat();
        a1.sound(); // calls Dog's version
        a2.sound(); // calls Cat's version
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Dog barks
Cat meows
```

**Key Points:**

* Interfaces are **100% abstract** (all methods abstract, unless default/static).
* A class can **implement multiple interfaces** (supports multiple inheritance).
* Forces the implementing class to define all methods.

---

### Use of Abstraction

* **Hides complexity** and exposes only the required functionality.
* Provides a **blueprint for subclasses**.
* Helps in **code reusability and maintainability**.
* Allows **programmers to focus on “what” instead of “how”**.
