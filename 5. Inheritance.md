# Four Pillars of OOP

Let's start by learning the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

---

## 1. Inheritance

### Definition
Inheritance is the process where one class (called the **child class** or **subclass**) can use the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class (called the **parent class** or **superclass**).  
In Java, this is done using the keyword **`extends`**.

---

### Example
```java
// Parent class (superclass)
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("I can eat");
    }
}

// Child class (subclass)
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("I can bark");
    }
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();   // inherited from Animal
        d.bark();  // defined in Dog
    }
}
````

**Output:**

```
I can eat
I can bark
```

---

### Key Points

* The subclass gets all **non-private variables and methods** of the superclass.
* **Constructors are not inherited**, but the subclass can call the parent constructor using `super()`.
* Supports **multilevel inheritance** (A → B → C), but not **multiple inheritance**.

---

### Use of Inheritance

* Reuse existing code.
* Avoid duplication.
* Build logical relationships, such as **"is-a"** (e.g., Dog *is-an* Animal).

```

Do you want me to continue this `.md` file by adding the other **three pillars (Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction)** in the same style?
