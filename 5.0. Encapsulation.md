Let's continue learning the final pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## 4. Encapsulation

### Definition

Encapsulation is the **process of wrapping data (variables)** and **methods (functions)** together into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some components.
It is used to **protect data** from unauthorized access and modification.

In Java, encapsulation is achieved by:

* Declaring **variables as `private`** (cannot be accessed directly).
* Providing **public getter and setter methods** to read and modify those variables safely.

### Example

```java
class Student {
    // Private data member
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Public getter method
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Public setter method
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        // Adding some validation
        if (age > 0) {
            this.age = age;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Age must be positive!");
        }
    }
}

public class EncapsulationDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student();
        s.setName("John");
        s.setAge(18);

        System.out.println("Student Name: " + s.getName());
        System.out.println("Student Age: " + s.getAge());
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Student Name: John
Student Age: 18
```

### Key Points

* **Private variables** ensure data hiding — they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
* **Public getters and setters** provide controlled access to the variables.
* We can add **validation logic** in setters to protect data integrity.

---

### Use of Encapsulation

* **Data Hiding:** Prevents direct modification of sensitive data.
* **Controlled Access:** You decide how data is read/written (using getters/setters).
* **Maintainability:** If variable names or logic change internally, external code doesn’t break.
* **Security:** Keeps class variables safe from unintended access or misuse.

Would you like me to also give a **real-world analogy** (like how encapsulation is like a capsule or a bank ATM) — this helps a lot in ICSE/board theory answers?
